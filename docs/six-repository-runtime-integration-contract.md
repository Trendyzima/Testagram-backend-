# Testagram six-runtime-repository integration contract

Status: implementation and staging contract; not production cutover authorization.
Reviewed: 2026-11-11.

This is the shared communication contract for six runtime repositories. `testagram-api` is the separate contract control plane, not a runtime service. Each runtime repository owns its domain; no repository may bypass the Backend's product authorization or become a second source of truth.

## Service ownership

| Repository | Runtime responsibility | Allowed communication |
|---|---|---|
| `testagram-flutter-client-` | Native Flutter UI, navigation, local presentation state, Appwrite session acquisition | Public authenticated Backend API only |
| `Testagram-backend-` | Canonical product authorization, account identity bridge, social API, PostgreSQL product state, media lifecycle, orchestration and outboxes | Appwrite Auth; private Algorithm, Data Centre and Federation contracts; public CDN URLs |
| `Testagram-data-centre-` | Private infrastructure API, storage nodes, video processing, notifications, VPS/runtime deployment, backup and operations | Private Backend/platform network; storage providers and node agents |
| `cdn-` | Media/HLS/DASH delivery, cache, origin/shield routing, range handling and playback-token validation | Public media requests and configured private/public origins; no product authorization |
| `federated-content` | ActivityPub actors, keys, inbox/outbox, signature verification, remote delivery and federation state | Private Backend actor/outbox APIs; remote ActivityPub peers |
| `the-algorithm` | Stateless feed ordering over an already-authorized bounded candidate set | Private Backend ranking API only |
| `testagram-api` (control plane; not a runtime) | OpenAPI, private contracts, event schemas, SDKs, source pins and cross-repository compatibility CI | No runtime requests, product data or authorization decisions |

## Canonical request paths

### Flutter -> Backend
- Flutter obtains an Appwrite session JWT and sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`.
- Backend validates the session and derives the canonical user identity server-side.
- Flutter must not call Algorithm, Federation, Data Centre platform APIs, PostgreSQL, or storage-provider credentials directly.
- The current client API base is configured through `TESTAGRAM_API_URL`; no private service URL or secret belongs in a Flutter build.

### Backend -> Algorithm
- Internal endpoint: `POST /v1/feed/rank`; readiness: `GET /readyz`.
- Backend sends `Authorization: Bearer <ALGORITHM_INTERNAL_TOKEN>`, `X-Testagram-API-Version: 1`, and `X-Request-ID`.
- Candidate request is bounded to 200 candidates; requested result limit is at most 50.
- Algorithm may return only IDs from the submitted candidate set. Backend validates the response and rechecks current visibility, blocks, follows and moderation before hydrating canonical posts.
- Deployment contract for the current `cmd/api` runtime: `ALGORITHM_URL=http://algorithm:8092` and `ALGORITHM_INTERNAL_TOKEN` must match Algorithm's `INTERNAL_TOKEN`. The `cmd/fresh-api` runtime uses `ALGORITHM_ENDPOINT` instead; do not mix the two runtime configurations.

### Backend <-> Federated Content
- Backend actor-resolution endpoints: `GET /internal/v1/federation/actors/{handle}`, `GET /internal/v1/federation/actors/by-id/{user_id}`, and readiness `GET /internal/v1/federation/readyz`.
- Backend publishes authorized activities to Federation at `POST /internal/v1/activities`.
- Publish request fields are `activity_id`, `actor_user_id`, and `activity`; duplicate activity IDs must be idempotent.
- Backend post transaction and outbox event must commit atomically. The dispatcher retries bounded batches and acknowledges only after durable Federation acceptance.
- Use separate credentials in each direction: Backend's `FEDERATION_INTERNAL_TOKEN` is mapped to Federation's `FEDERATION_INGRESS_TOKEN` for Backend -> Federation; Backend's `FEDERATION_BACKEND_INTERNAL_TOKEN` is mapped to Federation's `BACKEND_INTERNAL_TOKEN` for Federation -> Backend. Values must be independently generated; no legacy shared-token fallback is accepted. Never reuse Appwrite user JWTs as service credentials.
- Backend owns canonical remote follower relationships in `testagram_local.remote_follows`. Federation may cache accepted follower inboxes for delivery routing, but must call the private Backend Follow/Undo contract first. Undo must match the exact original Follow activity ID.
- An opted-in account's public post is inserted into the Backend transactional Federation outbox in the same database transaction as the post. ActivityPub object dereferencing is resolved from canonical Backend data and rechecks public visibility, account status and federation consent.
- Federation delivery, inbox and outbox polling remain disabled until signature, consent, replay, durability, idempotency and interoperability gates pass.

### Backend -> Data Centre
- Data Centre's platform listener is private (default port 8095). Current implemented routes include health/readiness/metrics, feature-flag configuration, event intake and audit intake.
- The Data Centre platform service is not a product API and does not own user identity, post visibility, media ownership, quota or retention decisions.
- The current integration PR adds a typed `internal/datacentreclient` for the five dedicated media lifecycle routes (`upload-url`, `verify`, `status`, `download-url`, `delete`). It uses `DATA_CENTRE_MEDIA_API_URL` plus `FRESH_DATA_CENTRE_INTERNAL_TOKEN`, sends API version 1, validates provider URLs and accepts the asynchronous `delete_pending` state. This is PR-branch implementation, not merged mainline proof until PR #206 is merged and its post-merge CI passes.
- The separate Data Centre platform listener (feature flags, events, audit, cache/queue/rate-limit and media-placement control APIs) still has no verified typed Backend client. Do not claim those platform integrations are active.
- In the self-hosted Backend Compose profile, the Backend stack creates the private Docker network `testagram-platform`; the Data Centre media service must join that external network, and port 8096 must not be published. Configure `DATA_CENTRE_MEDIA_API_URL=http://media:8096` and the same high-entropy `FRESH_DATA_CENTRE_INTERNAL_TOKEN` in Backend and Data Centre media. Keep `FRESH_MEDIA_ENABLED=false` until live B2/R2 and CDN acceptance passes.
- Data Centre media placement/replica evidence is not durable until byte count and SHA-256 are independently read back and verified.

### Backend -> CDN -> object origin
- Backend owns upload intent, authorization, visibility, quota, retention and deletion. It emits public URLs using `MEDIA_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.
- The Go CDN supports the stable `/v1/` media path and HLS/DASH paths. Configure `MEDIA_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://media.testagram.site/v1` only when DNS, TLS, CDN routing and the CDN origin are actually configured for that hostname and path.
- CDN is a delivery plane, not an authorization authority. Private objects require a key-bound, expiring playback token or an authenticated origin path; never mark private objects public or cache private responses as public.
- HLS playlists are short-lived; segments need cache lifetimes consistent with the playlist window. Range requests and content type must be preserved.

## Shared reliability and security rules
- JSON over HTTP(S); use HTTPS for public endpoints and private-network HTTP only for explicitly private service hostnames.
- Use distinct high-entropy service credentials per direction and audience; keep them in server-side secret stores only.
- Propagate a request ID across each service hop. Never log JWTs, service tokens, signed URLs, private content, or raw authorization headers.
- Enforce strict JSON schemas, body and batch limits, request deadlines, bounded concurrency and bounded retries.
- Retry only operations that are idempotent or protected by an idempotency key. A 2xx acknowledgement means durable acceptance only where the receiving contract explicitly guarantees it.
- Preserve privacy, blocks, moderation and deletion tombstones across every projection and delivery path.
- Readiness must include required dependencies, not merely process liveness. Optional ranking may fall back only according to explicit Backend policy.
- Use additive/versioned changes. Update both producer and consumer plus shared fixtures and tests before emitting a new contract.

## Known integration gates (not to be represented as completed)
- Backend -> Data Centre typed platform client and matching route coverage are not verified as implemented.
- TV catalogue API `GET /api/tv/catalog` is not registered in the Backend mainline; the health-monitor workflow cannot run successfully until a catalogue source and endpoint are implemented.
- CDN production hostname/origin wiring and private-media end-to-end verification must be checked in the deployed environment; repository configuration alone is not proof.
- Data Centre's documented API route inventory must match the actual platform server handlers before clients are generated.
- Full cross-repository contract tests and deployment smoke tests must pass against the same immutable image versions before production promotion.

## Release acceptance
1. Verify each repository's own CI on the proposed integration branch.
2. Run producer/consumer contract tests for Flutter/Backend, Backend/Algorithm, Backend/Federation, Backend/Data Centre and Backend/CDN media URL behavior.
3. Verify private-network DNS, ports, TLS, secrets, readiness and timeouts in staging.
4. Exercise authorization failures, malformed/oversized payloads, duplicate requests, upstream outage, retry and recovery.
5. Verify media upload -> completion -> CDN retrieval, including private-media denial and byte-range behavior.
6. Keep all changes in reviewable PRs. Merge and deploy only after the release owner explicitly approves the verified set.
